Here I am publishing the list of files I am working right now or I am planning to work soon. The list is
actually is made from smallest non-translated files. Don't take these files to translate unless I am dissappeared for some
time. There is lot of work for other files.
Translated files are marked with '+' before they are synchronized with the original repository. After it, they
are deleted from the list. To see if an actual file translated or not, just check in the repo.
