@0    = ~HAHA, the pathetic paladin dares to approach once again.~
@1    = ~You feed on innocent children and destroy the life of their families. We cannot let you go on.~
@2    = ~Your mortal morals are irrelevant for me. Each child's soul gives me a ten day stay on your plane.~
@3    = ~And a demon's death on the surface gives him two hundred years of suffering in the abyss.~
@4    = ~Ha, that almost sounds like a threat if it did not come from my next victim.~
@5    = ~Paladin, I see you brought some company to go down with you. That makes seven tendays for me at once, hahaha.~
@6    = ~I prefer the mentioned two hundred years of suffering for you.~
@7    = ~Paladin, you and your reinforcements against mine.~
