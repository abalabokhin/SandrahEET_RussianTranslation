@0    = ~You never had a chance to succeed - neither for your own ambitions nor for the case you had really followed Bhaal's orders.~
@1    = ~YOU!! Priestess, you and your goddess have dared to intervene again and again. You should not be here at all but dead since long already. But never mind, this will all be corrected now.~
@2    = ~With the essence of Qilandrha missing from your equations and the power of Mystra against you, you will fail.~
@3    = ~Who by the Nine Hells is Qilandrha?~
@4    = ~I am Qilandrha - born to Khalindra of Mystra's bloodline, sired by Bhaal.~
@5    = ~Tragic if it were not so laughable, Amelyssan. Did Bhaal not tell you about the one he spawned to end Mystra's line? The one who has more of the essence than the Five or even <CHARNAME>.~
@6    = ~A silly bluff - if such a power existed I would know it...it is impossible...Unless - the spawn failed and you are Mystra's descendent who survived...~
@7    = ~It is even worse for you, as Qilandrha has defeated the calling of her blood and turned it into a power against Bhaal and yourself.~
@8    = ~It is even worse for you, as I have defeated the calling of my blood and turned it into a power against Bhaal and yourself.~
