@0    = ~Hello, I am Sister Revianel, you have met our little Isobel already. The poor child has lost her mother to an orc attack just a few days ago. And with her father killed by bandits just last winter she is now with us, the poor darling.~
@1    = ~She seemed to be quite cheerful nonetheless.~
@2    = ~It is wonderful to see how everything has been set up here. Without you and this home, the poor girl would be begging out on the streets today.~
@3    = ~Yes, it is all due to the wonderful Imoen of Candlekeep. She has set up this home for the little ones like Izzy, I mean Isobel. And Imoen is also a great inspiration for our children in how she keeps up her positive attitude even in the darkest perils she has to face. Our children just love her. And her steadfast companion Henning, of course.~
@4    = ~She is a great woman for sure. I think we can afford to contribute a bit to the success of this home.~
@5    = ~She sure has her good sides, but please keep an eye on the language your children learn - let them not follow the famous Imoen in her endless babbling. ~
@6    = ~If you want to make a donation to us, the temple nearby will gladly accept that. Meanwhile feel free to look at everything here. Have a good day.~
@7    = ~Hello and welcome again.~
