@0    = ~Sandrah!!~
@1    = ~<CHARNAME>!~
@2    = ~Drizzt!! I have recognised your recent tracks already and was so nervous you would start the final battle alone.~
@3    = ~Oh, my ever-caring Sandrah...I have to admit I might have been so foolish if I could have only got beyond that door here alone.~
@4    = ~I received the reports from the friends you rescued and also from brother Martin, so I was able to sneak up to here. But now I found myself stuck.~
@5    = ~It is good we are all here together to free Cattie-Brie and end this spook. You would have risked your life uselessly without the dragon breath we have captured to destroy that cursed crystal.~
@6    = ~Good to hear, my friends. Let us face those bastards then and put an end to their intrigue!~
@7    = ~Fine, have your spells and weapons ready, we enter Enteri's lair.~
@8    = ~We will go as soon as we are healed and rested. There is no other way from here than ahead.~
