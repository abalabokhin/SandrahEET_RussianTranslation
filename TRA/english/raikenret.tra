@1    = ~Hello, old friend. Do you wish to follow the path that your former bosses already have paved for you?~
@2    = ~I followed YOUR path, girl, and it wasn't too hard with the wreckage you leave behind across the Coast. I come for the promise you gave me, haha.~
@3    = ~Yes, I remember, was it not that I said you may become my boss in Tazok's troups?~
@4    = ~Exactly, little pussycat.~
@5    = ~And you want to be that, even now that you know what happens to all those bosses I meet?~
@6    = ~Ha, they took you for a little city beauty on an adventure trip. I know you better, so I am prepared...~
