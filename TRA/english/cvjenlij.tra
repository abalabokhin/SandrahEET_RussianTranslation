@10   = ~Families consist of our fellow rookmates, we hatched at same time and became innate on same festive day. Cadre is strong bound, we form psychic bonds in line of command. Jen'lig would control her subordinates fast and efficient in battle this way.~

@138  = ~There are lots of them and cheap to buy - maybe even a killed foe carries one.~
@139  = ~(Hiss) Prime creatures not know worth of silver. Good for magical things. If find, give to Jen'lig. Githyanki can put to good use.~
@140  = ~If we find one we keep it for you, sure.~
@141  = ~At your command, my lady.~
@142  = ~Not a big challenge, we'll do if it pleases you. You obviously seem to like all that ornamental stuff.~

@167  = ~A new side of you, Jen'lig? You care for one who was too weak to defend against such a curse?~

@183  = ~It looks like a quite useful weapon to keep, unless you oppose in the name of the githyanki.~
@184  = ~You do and keep...but, <CHARNAME> commander, soon will come those who seek for it. Make not fight but give what due to them. Jen'lig cares for her commander, want not hurt for nothing.~

@194  = ~South to the Friendly Arm then. Good to have companions who keep their eyes open.~
@195  = ~(Hiss) Useless manling god gave seed to make <CHARNAME>. Concept of gods is crap but creature to spawn commander was strong - made commander strong...~

@259  = ~Damned, you never give up! I warned Semaj not to mingle with a kin who are fearsome and tireless foe who don't know when to quit.~
@260  = ~That name of thief? Semaj. Where is that man? Speak your last word, mammal.~
@261  = ~Ha, he's chosen his company well, that conjurer. Even you will not be able to touch Sarevok's adjutant. You will not even survive the current encounter, lizard woman.~
@262  = ~We have information that you were involved in robbing and murdering a wounded githyanki.~
@263  = ~Not use deny, mammal. You on list of murderers.~
@264  = ~Sunin dead already. We know sword with Semaj who with Sarevok.~
@265  = ~Who told you, that coward Sunin? Baah, I knew the mage would whine like a girl when meeting your kin.~
@266  = ~(Hiss) New name on list, Sunin. Jen'lig finds if seeks whole Baldur's Gate city.~
@267  = ~You found that coward Sunin? Baah, I knew the mage would whine like a girl when meeting your kin.~
@268  = ~It makes not difference what you know or not know, you will not leave here to make use of that information.~
@269  = ~Pathetic weakling. Can never break slavery by own force. Set him free, <CHARNAME>. Slavery shall not endure anyone.~
@270  = ~With you, strange creature, I am not sure my skills will be sufficient.~
@271  = ~Manling not worry. Companion Sandrah better than any githyanki g'lathk for heeling.~
@272  = ~Let me begin.~
@273  = ~(HISS!!) Beware, my captain, evil lurks!~
@274  = ~*You have the feeling that a voice manifests itself inside your brain. Underneath the swirl and hiss of many tongues some words are audible.*~
@275  = ~This is the wrong place, no entry to below...WHAT?? Where does THAT creature come from?~
@276  = ~An Illithid searching for food, maybe searching for our hatcheries! (HISS!!)~
@277  = ~(HISS!!) Just a minor one and almost dead already.~
@278  = ~Those are your enemies and former masters, Jen'lig?~
@279  = ~Was Illithid. Searching food which is manling's or beast's brains. Or maybe searched for hatchery of my kin's eggs. (Hiss). Be good for you was dying and not strong.~
@280  = ~I heard that creature talking - it was inside my head!~
@281  = ~He created sounds and pictures in my head, I saw an injured elf and heard him talk!~
@282  = ~(Hiss) Try to talk? Maybe try to take control of my captain, is way of Illithid fighting and enslaving.~
@283  = ~Jen'lig swear to protect her captain from Mind Flayers with own life.~
@284  = ~You are quite brave to stand up to such beasts.~
@285  = ~I think I start to understand why your kin are such scary fighters.~
@286  = ~Will not go apprentice of Kastya's murderer. Share life with scum, die with scum.~
@287  = ~What kind of creature are you anyway?~
@288  = ~The darkness lifts, the spell is broken - here is the sword.~
@289  = ~You sorcerer be Semaj.~
@290  = ~So it is true, you githyanki never give up the hunt for a silver sword. Baah, but you are alone, just like the one that carried the sword.~
@291  = ~Jen'lig not alone, is supreme Planewalker with commander <CHARNAME> and most powerful  force of the prime. Is end of Semaj and end of sword hunt.~
@292  = ~It's a bunch of fools coming to sacrifice themselves to the new God of Murder and his chosen!~
@293  = ~That's a githyanki hiding 'neath those thief's clothing, right. No wonder ol' Phandalyn is huffing and puffing with righteous fury and all.~
@294  = ~(Hiss) Small manling sharp eyes. Hope mind is also sharp and will not yell loudly about what sees.~
@295  = ~I'm Just a friend tryin' to warn ya. ~
@296  = ~Warn of Phandalyn? ~
@297  = ~He is a powerful paladin here in the city and he poses a grave danger to you. I would suggest that you avoid him altogether. You can usually find him in one of the taverns close to the docks, but I don't recommend you do. If you have business there, I suggest you do it after sundown. ~
@298  = ~Manling paladins call themselves men of honour. They see not honour when vision is blurred by their manling gods they follow. (Hiss.)~
