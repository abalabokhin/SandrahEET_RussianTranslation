@2    = ~So far every ogre we have met was our enemy, Valiant sword or not, it never mattered.~
@3    = ~Do you think that it will help to give it back to them. They have attacked us before we had the sword as well.~
@4    = ~Kahrk has brother. Kharaz already knows you have killed and stolen sword. Kharaz hunt you and get you.~
@5    = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>, they attack us even if we gave them the sword. We have killed Kahrk, just in case they would need a justification.~
