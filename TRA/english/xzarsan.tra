@0    = ~Well, you've seen me gather the hearts' blood of several creatures, no? I use these collectibles in my experiments. I don't understand why, but almost everyone seems to have some little distaste for my efforts. But a healer like you surely understands.~
@1    = ~Definitely not, necromancer.~
@2    = ~My Goddess allows me to use the power of the Weave to heal and even resurrect those whose life was taken prematurely before his or her time on Toril had come. It is an act of healing in this case and can only be applied before the soul has left the body completely and when the flesh has not decayed beyond a certain amount. It has nothing to do with your acts of Necromancy and your foul practices. The powers you use are not of the Weave but mostly drained from the life power of other creatures, just like a vampire drinks the blood of the living.~
@3    = ~Negligible little details, honey child, you bring them back from death - I bring them back.~
@4    = ~The ones I bring back are what they were before. The ones you produce are monstrosities enthralled to your will.~
@5    = ~Are your summoned monsters any better?~
@6    = ~(Sandrah has already moved on without noticing Xzar's last response.)~
