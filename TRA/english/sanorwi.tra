@0    = ~NOOO! Not any more stinking orcs!!~
@1    = ~AH, no orcs , my rescue. Dear travellers, please protect me from these orcs!~
@2    = ~You saw orcs, where and when, where did they run to? MAN, don't stand there open-mouthed, quickest tell us all!~
@3    = ~A large orc hord indeed, thirty or more, and in quite a hurry.~
@4    = ~Did you see a prisoner with them, a man, a human?~
@5    = ~Some of them where carrying a large sack, the size of a human, but what was inside? I had no chance to see and did not dare to look either. Just ran.~
@6    = ~But there is no trace hereabouts, they ran along further. Did you see whereto?~
@7    = ~They took to north-east over there, the way to the halflings village of Gullykin. They must be there before daybreak if they run on like this.~
@8    = ~Are you sure that it was north-east? That would not lead them to the Cloakwood at all.~
@9    = ~Surely not. They stopped for a while at that fork of the road yonder, shouting and quarrelling, I was almost hoping they would kill each other. But they took the other way, that is for sure.~
@10   = ~They are orcs and without a brain to lead them on. Maybe they really just took the wrong way. Why should they want to go to the halflings village?~
