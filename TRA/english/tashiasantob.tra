@0    = ~Is that a look of approval on my spellcasting, Sandrah?~
@1    = ~(Laughs) Oh, no, even as a disciple of the Goddess of All Magic it is not my role to judge other's talents. I was just once again fascinated by the fact that sorcerers have such a natural feeling and skill for their art, other than the scroll users that recite their texts.~
@2    = ~I understand it is not so much different from your own way - even if you in person seem to be different again from all other priests I have encountered.~
@3    = ~You are right, some abilities come to me almost naturally - I guess pretty similar to your own experiences.~
@4    = ~Yes and no - I still see a slight difference as I get new spells to my repertoire with experience but they are, hm, traditional arcana. You seem to *invent* new stuff which is based on the personal experience you make.~
@5    = ~Hm, I have never given it much thought before but I guess that is a valid observation. I often discovered some new ability after a certain experience I made or a foe I defeated.~
@6    = ~Do you have some explanation for it - I mean even for Mystra's priests that is quite unusual?~
@7    = ~If it is not a very special talent than it is maybe my blood relationship to the Goddess.~
@8    = ~All those healing spells of yours are something that are not granted to me.~
@9    = ~As a priestess I have specialized from the beginning in this aspect of the Weave's powers. The spells are just a tool, Tashia, I have tried to learn much more about the physical and spiritual bodies of the mortals in order to help and heal them.~
@10   = ~Do you think you would have become a healer even if you had not the access to magic?~
@11   = ~Hm, I probably would, even if that task would require much more dedication and time for the patients. I could never have gone on an adventuring quest like we do as the quick help and first aid required in our battles would not be possible without magic.~
@12   = ~Mystra be thanked for it then.~
@13   = ~Still I study the non-magical arts whenever I can. Especially the mind and the temper of a person can rarely be cured by some quickly cast spells. If you want to help a grieving or distorted person you must take your time and explore the other one deeply and carefully.~
@14   = ~One must be a very caring person to offer such help...maybe one day I may ask you about that again.~
@15   = ~I will always take my time for you, be assured, Tashia.~
