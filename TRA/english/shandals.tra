@0    = ~You are as impertinent as your ever-intruding father, daughter of the hated mage!!~
@1    = ~Always willing to interfere if I encounter magelings like yourself - so much is true.~
@2    = ~Zentharim spies, Thayvan red scum, Halruuan wrong doers, you are on my list.~
@3    = ~Ha, does your goddess give you the right to judge those who are favoured by herself...~
@4    = ~You are surely not favoured by Mystra, pretentious imposter. The goddess does not need to personally pronounce her verdict on your misdeeds with her gifts - that is the task of those who follow her calling.~
@5    = ~If you think you can play judge and jury and executioner here in Mystra's name you err, Sandrah of Waterdeep. Neither your father nor your goddess will assist you against the wrath of Shandalar!~
